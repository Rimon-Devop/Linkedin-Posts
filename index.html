                    After building 100+ WordPress websites (and earning $100k+ on Upwork), here's my plugin list that I
                    use on
                    90%
                    of projects.

                    Most developers overcomplicate their stack.

                    I keep it simple and focus on what actually works.

                    MY MUST HAVE PLUGINS:

                    1. Elementor for visual building and design
                    The most flexible page builder I've worked with.

                    2. WPS Hide Login for security
                    First thing I do on every site. Hiding the login URL stops 90% of automated attacks before they
                    start.

                    3. Rank Math SEO for search optimization
                    Everything you need for technical SEO without the bloat.

                    4. WP Rocket for performance
                    Best caching plugin, hands down. My sites consistently score 90+ on PageSpeed with this.

                    PLUGINS I USE OFTEN:

                    5. Gravity Forms when clients need advanced forms
                    More flexible than free alternatives and saves hours of custom coding.

                    6. WP Mail SMTP for reliable email delivery
                    Not all hosts handle email well. This plugin fixes that in 5 minutes.

                    7. WP Activity Log when multiple admins exist
                    Game changer for debugging. You can see exactly who changed what and when.

                    8. Custom Post Type UI + ACF for custom content
                    Perfect combo for building custom solutions without writing a theme from scratch.

                    This setup has helped me maintain a 100% job success score and Top Rated Plus badge.

                    What plugins would you add to this list?

                <p>
                    For performance / caching: Instead of WP Rocket, I recommend using Perfmatters + Super Page Cache
                    combo with
                    Cloudflare.

                    For SMTP, I would use Fluent SMTP works flawlessly and free version supports logging. For clients
                    that
                    don't have an easy-to-setup SMTP server (for example if they are using Office 365, then I recommend
                    using
                    SMTP2GO which has a dedicated WordPress plugin and very easy to setup, great for transactional
                    emails, free
                    up to 1000 emails per month)

                    Instead of WPS Hide Login for security, I would use Wordfence and block / rate limit access to
                    /wp-login.php
                    and /xmlrpc.php using Cloudflare free plan's custom rules.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The WP Activity Log point is underrated.

                    I've worked on sites where multiple people had admin access and tracking down who changed a setting
                    or
                    deleted content was impossible. Having a log of every action makes debugging faster and stops the "I
                    didn't
                    touch anything" conversations.

                    It's also useful for catching plugin conflicts. When something breaks after an update, you can see
                    exactly
                    what changed and when.

                    I would add Wordfence for the site security incase any vulnerability happens,
                    I can always scan and know what went wrong.

                    That way i keep the site safe and I am way ahead of any security glitches.

                <p>
                    Any automated scanner can still detect the real login endpoint in seconds, so 'Hide login' plugins
                    do
                    nothing for you. Limiting access to /wp-admin at the network level (e.g. Cloudflare WAF) is far more
                    effective than hiding the login URL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throw in there perfmatters and and a good cache plugin like flying press or wp rocket. Otherwise I
                    completely agree!

                How I found my first job on Upwork in just a few cover letters.

                But that was in 2018, and competition was different...

                I've earned over $100k on Upwork now, and today I want to share how it all started.

                Back in 2018, I was another freelancer trying to break through. Zero completed jobs, zero reviews, zero
                trust.

                My strategy was simple: aim for small projects, around $20-$100. I knew nobody would hire a freelancer
                with 0 jobs for big or important projects.

                After a few cover letters, I got my first project - converting a design from Adobe XD to HTML/CSS. I
                still remember this project clearly.

                I made extra features that the client didn't ask for, just to impress them. It worked well.

                But here's the thing nobody tells you:

                Getting the second project was HARDER than the first one.

                I thought after landing the first job, the second would be easy. I was wrong.

                It took me more than 2 weeks of daily monitoring, sending cover letters, and getting no responses. It
                was frustrating, but I didn't stop.

                My advice for new freelancers on Upwork:

                1. Start with small projects, You need testimonials that prove you're reliable and won't disappear after
                2 days.
                2. Only apply for jobs you can do 80%+ confidently, Your first projects must be done 100%. You don't
                have the luxury to figure things out as you go.
                3. Spend time on quality cover letters. Create hooks, demonstrate you understand the task, and show the
                client they can relax.

                Today I have 100% Job Success Score and Top Rated Plus badge (only 3% of Upwork freelancers have it).

                But it all started with that $50 project and refusing to give up after week 2.

                What was your biggest challenge when you started freelancing?
